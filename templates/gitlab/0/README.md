# GitLab CE

GitLab CE is a free alternative to GitHub

~~Stack based on official GitLab version: latest~~

~~https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ce/~~

Edit: the official image is terrible, they clearly do not understand how
docker works, instead I am going to use the amazing [gitlab](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-gitlab) from [sameersbn](https://github.com/sameersbn/)

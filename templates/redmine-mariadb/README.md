[Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/)

Redmine is a flexible project management web application. Written using
the Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database.

This rancher template should get you a redmine container up and running
to test.  To see an implementation using convoy for persistent data see
the catalog [here](https://github.com/webhostingcoopteam/whc-catalog)
